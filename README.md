# LED-Face-Mask
When the pandemic was at it's high, I wanted a facemask that stood out from the crowd.

It features multiple WS2812b LED strips that were daisy-chained together to give the illusion of an LED matrix.

The code I have uploaded is by no means original, and largely borrowed, but it what I eventually uploaded to my arduino and used.
